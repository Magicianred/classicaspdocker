# Classic ASP Docker

This is an updated version of this repo https://github.com/ImranMA/CodeSamples/tree/master/aspClassic-Docker. To demonstrate how a classic ASP application can be containerised and then deployed to a web app for containers (with a Windows service plan)


## Changes
1. Dockerfile has a fixed download reference
2. Added some Classic ASP code to enumerate environment variables to see how these may be injected by Azure Web Apps for Containers.
